# Field Guide
An addon for World of Warcraft: Classic.

`/fg` and `/fieldguide` will open the window.
`/fg minimap` and `/fieldguide minimap` will toggle the minimap button on or off.

Use shift + scroll to scroll horizontally.

Right click to mark spells as unwanted.

Shift-right click a spell to mark all ranks of that spell as unwanted.

## Features
- Shows you which spells each class learns every level to plan when you need to go back to town.
- Shows you which classes can learn which weapon skills (staves, one-handed swords and so on).
- Tells you how much each spell/weapon skill costs to train so you know if you can afford it or not (includes PvP rank and reputation modifiers).
- You can filter out known spells and/or talents.
- You can mark unwanted spells by right clicking on them. Shift-right clicking on a spell will mark all the ranks of that spell.
- You can drag a spell from the addon onto an action bar.

## Planned Features (in no particular order)
- Show ranks for each spell (there is currently no way of doing this with the API).
- Show AQ tomes and spells that are gained through quests (such as the Mage's Conjure Water rank 7 from DM).
- When clicking on a weapon skill, the addon should create a TomTom arrow, and mark the trainer on your map and minimap.
- When clicking on any spell, it should also do the same as above â€“ except it will choose the nearest trainer to where you are. (Perhaps an option to prioritize the nearest trainer with which the player is Honored for the 10% reduction in cost.)
- Show Warlock/Hunter pet skills.

## Bugs
- Ranks do not show in spell tooltips.
- Some spells and ranks might be wrong, as I've gone off private server and Classic Wowhead (please get an API) data, both of which currently aren't very accurate. For example, on a certain private server, Shadowburn rank 6 costs 2g 20s while it should cost 11s only (baseline).
